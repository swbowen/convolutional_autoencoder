# convolutional_autoencoder
This repository contains a colab notebook with code for a convolutional autoencoder trained on CIFAR-10. It also
includes the network's output after five epochs of training, a comparison of input and output images, and a few
plots comparing the learned latent-space representations of different classes of CIFAR-10 images.
